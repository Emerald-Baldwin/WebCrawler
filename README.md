WebCrawler
==========
This is a short script that is designed to teach me about web crawling, the perl language, and regex.
Upcoming tasks:<br><br>
   Correctly storing previous webpages visited<br>
   Leaving webpage after too much time has passed<br>
   Checking if each page has a robots.txt and using that instead of attempting to crawl the page
